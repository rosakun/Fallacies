"As time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase, the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease.",nothing
"Scientists such as Dr Willie Soon, a solar astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, have shown that as water vapor rises, so does temperature. It is why cloudless nights are so chilly.",nothing
"Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century.",nothing
"Sea ice thickness also substantially declined in the latter half of the 20th century, the snow and ice data center said.",nothing
The world’s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet experienced melting over more than 50% of its surface.,nothing
"These facts are completely supported by 4,000 ocean floats.",nothing
"Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean, and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere.",nothing
"Last year's warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst coral bleaching event on record and large scale coral death, to the Arctic, where sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were also the warmest on record, at least from January through September 2016.",nothing
"We have known for decades that increasing CO2 and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century, it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent.",nothing
"Because the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically, the continued existence of the world's great coastal cities — Miami, New York, Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica's fate.",nothing
"Warm weather worsened the most recent five-year drought, which included the driest four-year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation. California’s first-, second-, and third-hottest years on record, in terms of statewide average temperatures, were 2014, 2015, and 2016.",nothing
Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic's summer sea-ice cover.,nothing
"At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said. The lack of ice in the Antarctic, where it is currently summer, is most pronounced in the Amundsen Sea, where only a few scattered patches of ice remain.",nothing
"Incorporating recent advances in the understanding of how ice sheets might break apart, they found that both West Antarctica and some vulnerable parts of East Antarctica would go into an unstoppable collapse if the Earth continued to warm at a rapid pace. In their worst-case scenario, the sea level could rise by six feet by the end of this century, and the pace could pick up drastically in the 22nd century. Dr. DeConto and Dr. Pollard do not claim that this is a certainty — they acknowledge that their analysis is still rough — but they argue that the possibility should be taken seriously.",nothing
"An inherent bias in scientific journals in favor of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification, which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",nothing
"The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century. The risk is that the rate will increase still more. Scientists who study the Earth's history say waters could rise by a foot per decade in a worst-case scenario, though that looks unlikely. Many experts believe that even if emissions stopped tomorrow, 15 or 20 feet of sea level rise is already inevitable, enough to flood many cities unless trillions of dollars are spent protecting them. How long it will take is unclear. But if emissions continue apace, the ultimate rise could be 80 or 100 feet.",nothing
"CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent.",nothing
"The atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is five years and it is quickly sequestered into plants, marine life, oceans, and sediments.",nothing

Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems.,nothing
"Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain. This is not only true for the Marshall Islands. Several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century, resulting in a net increase in island area.",nothing
The Northern Hemisphere jet stream flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large. But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes.,nothing
"In 2004, two NOAA scientists, Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine, produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels. But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last century.",nothing
"Australias Great Barrier Reef is one of the world’s greatest reservoirs of biodiversity. A World Heritage site, it is currently under assault from unusually hot ocean temperatures.",nothing
"Consider where they move. Migration patterns show people heading for warm states like Texas and Florida, not snowy Minnesota and Michigan.",nothing
"This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year.",nothing
Climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.,nothing
"In 2004, two NOAA scientists, Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine, produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels.

But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.,nothing
"The U.S. National Climate Assessment found that U.S. heat waves have already become more frequent and intense, that the U.S. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records (just as you’d expect), and that it is seeing correspondingly fewer cold spells.",nothing
The blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer.,nothing
Construction and maintenance of wind and solar facilities release far more carbon dioxide than they are meant to save over their working lives and they need to be supported 24/7 by coal-fired generators.,nothing
Even more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelocks passionate support for nuclear power.,nothing
"The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever. Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.",nothing
"Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades. The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.",nothing
"The heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic, with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean.",nothing
"In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010. But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.",nothing
"In the past, the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has been orders of magnitude higher than now, yet there were ice ages.",nothing
"Arctic land stores about twice as much carbon as the atmosphere. While growing seasons—which are now either longer or newly possible, depending on the exact location—suck in carbon dioxide during the spring and summer, scientists believe the thawing lands are now emitting more carbon than they take in.",nothing
"Antarctica, the planet’s largest ice sheet, lost 219 billion tons of ice annually from 2012 through 2017 — approximately triple the 73 billion ton melt rate of a decade ago, the scientists concluded. From 1992 through 1997, Antarctica lost 49 billion tons of ice annually.",nothing
"How did a wet Western winter lead to a sky-choking summer? The answer lies in the summer’s record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts. Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August.",nothing
"According to the satellites, the late 2016 temperatures are returning to the levels they were at after the 1998 El Nino.",nothing
So it’s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm—because the last El Nino ended a year ago.,nothing
"The dry periods are drier and the wet periods are wetter, said Jeffrey Mount, a water expert and senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.",nothing
"Warm weather worsened the most recent five-year drought, which included the driest four-year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation. California’s first-, second- and third-hottest years on record, in terms of statewide average temperatures, were 2014, 2015, and 2016.",nothing
"CO2 is going up, but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would. The computer models just weren’t reliable.",nothing
These effects could add 50% to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions.,nothing
"the researchers calculated that the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from wet soils, or wetlands, will be higher than from drier soils. This finding, if further confirmed, could reorient calculations of the overall potential of permafrost to worsen global warming over the coming century.",nothing
Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions.,nothing
"Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run, though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run.",nothing
"In the U.S. about 9,000 people die from heat each year but 144,000 die from cold.",nothing
Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega-droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past.,nothing
climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.,nothing
Representatives from the Marshall Islands have been vocal about the need for strong global action on climate. President Hilda Heine has told reporters that longtime residents are leaving the Marshall Islands because climate change is threatening the nation’s existence.,nothing
"Sea level rise is global. But due to a variety of factors – including, for this part of the Atlantic coast, a likely weakening of the Gulf Stream, itself potentially a result of the melting of Greenland’s ice caps – south Floridians are feeling the effects more than many others. While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.",nothing
"His Gaia hypothesis, which contends that the earth is a single, self-regulating organism, is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science.",nothing
Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off.,nothing
"In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010. But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.",nothing
"The amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic has steadily declined over the past few decades because of man-made global warming, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",nothing
"Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.",nothing
"The ‘ancient carbon’ of Alaska’s tundras is being released, starting a vicious warming cycle. This is ancient carbon, thousands and millions of years old. It’s being released much earlier than we thought.",nothing

The Northern Hemisphere jet stream flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large. But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes.,nothing
"The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities.",nothing
"The rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.",nothing
"Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities, but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016.",nothing
Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called ‘sunny-day flooding’ — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years. The sea is now so near the brim in many places that they believe the problem is likely to worsen quickly.,nothing
"The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link.",nothing
"As surface temperatures of the oceans warm up, the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere. We’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods.",nothing
"We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.",nothing

Some countries are already talking about banning the sale of gasoline cars after 2030.,nothing
"In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible.",nothing
The planet’s average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F (0.9C).,nothing
"Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.",nothing
