# HEFA - High-quality Examples of Fallacious Arguments

We present HEFA, a dataset containing fallacious arguments labeled by their respesctive fallacy type.\ 
We use the same fallacy taxonomy as [MAFALDA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09761) .

## Data collection methods

We collect data by:
1) Relabeling data from existing datasets and manually selecting quality examples.
2) Collecting examples from various internet sites, for example [Quillbot](https://quillbot.com/blog/ad-populum-fallacy/).
3) Prompting GPT-3.5.
